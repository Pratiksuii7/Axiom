<h1>Tools engine</h1>
<p>Tools engine is a platform where i have made many tools like 3d solar system, projectile motion simulator and etc. It is completely open source and can be customized by the user.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Below here is a list of different tools present here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>3D Solar System - A 3D simulator that simulates the solar system.Fun part: We can customize orbital speed too.</li>
<li>BMI Calculator - A simple BMI calculator where we can calculate if we are underweight, overweight or normal.</li>
<li>Wave Simulator - A simulator where we can simulate wave's, we can observe its heatmap, customize amplitude and wavelength too</li>
<li>Number Systems Converter - A Number System converter where we can input a number and we can get that number in different number systems.</li>
<li>Geometry Calculator - A calculator where we can do geometric calculations like finding area, perimeter.</li>
<li>4 band resistor's Resistance counter - A resistance counter where we can count a resistor's resistance(4 band)</li>
<li>Data Visualizer - A tool that can be used to make charts of data's. It is very useful for observing datas.</li>
<li>Projectile Motion Simulator - A simulator where we can simulate and observe projectile motion.Here, we can customize the value of factors too.</li>
<li>Collisions Simulator - A 2d collisions simulator where we can observe the collision between two objects where we can customize its size,mass etc.</li>
<li>Pendulum Simulator - A simulator of pendulum where we can observe it and here, we can customize rod length, mass and etc.</li>
<li>Charges Simulator - A simulator where we can simulate proton and electron and watch its magnetic field.</li>
<li>Probability Graph Visualizer - A math tool where we can visualize the probability.It gives expressions too. </li>
<li>Path Finder Visualizer - A visualizer computer science related visualizing tool where we can make or generare maze then visualize its path.</li>
<li>Chaos Simulator - A double pendulum chaotic simulator where we can simulate 2 pendulums with customizable characteristics of both pendulum. </li>
<li>Fourier Epicycles - A visualization tool that is used to visualize how the complex shapes can be represented through rotating circles. </li>
<li>Prime Number Spiral Visualizer - A visualization tool that is used to visualize all the prime numbers up to 7919 and it was quite fun to build.</li>
<li>Ball Collision Simulator- An awesome collision simulator which is used to simulate balls in canvas with real type of physics calculations.</li>
</ol>
